A Santa lived as a devil at NASA
Was it a dog or a cat I saw?
Eva, can I see bees in a cave now?
Madam, in Eden I’m Eve
Never odd or even numbers
Doc, note I dissent. A fast never prevents a slow diet on cod.
No lemon, no melon pie
Step on no pet frogs
Do geese see ducks?
Yo, Banana Boat!
Evil rats on no stars live
Taco cat salad
Red roses run no risk on Thursdays
Sir, I demand a pizza and a maid named Iris
Was it Eliot’s toilet I sat on?
Murder for a jar of cold brew
Some men interpret nine llamas
Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new beginnings?
Borrow or rent?
Racecar driver
