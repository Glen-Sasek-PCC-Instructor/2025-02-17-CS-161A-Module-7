A Santa at NASA
Was it a car or a cat I saw
A Toyota’s a Toyota
Eva, can I see bees in a cave?
Madam, in Eden I’m Adam
Never odd or even
Doc, note I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
No lemon, no melon
Step on no pets
Do geese see God?
Yo, Banana Boy!
Evil rats on no star live
Taco cat
Red roses run no risk, sir, on nurses order
Sir, I demand, I am a maid named Iris
Was it Eliot’s toilet I saw?
Murder for a jar of red rum
Some men interpret nine memos
Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?
Borrow or rob?
